# Noah Flewelling Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project.  
It represents who I am, what I’ve built, and how I approach design and development.  
Please use the bio in **bio.txt** for tone, style, and accurate personal details when updating any content or layout.

## 🧠 Project Context

The goal is to polish and finalize the site before deployment.  
Keep the tone friendly, humble, and authentic to my story.  
Maintain existing layouts and responsiveness.  
When in doubt, keep it simple, clean, and visually balanced.
