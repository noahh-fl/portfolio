# Noah Flewelling - Personal Bio and Tone Guide

## Background
ive always been making things on my computer, or my parents, and grandparents, whichever computer i had access, i tried to learn how to use it. started mostly with gaming, steam games mostly and simple web games. i got a macbook when i turned 11 and was also given a subscriptin to the creative cloud. taught myself how to use photoshop, illustrator, premier, ect. started making movies, using mostly imovie caus premier was confusing at first. experieemtned with visual effects, green screen, cloning, simple little skills to help me fulfill a vision i had for a project. they were just humble short movies i would show to the family, nothing crazy. i just like having a final product a lot and i think that were my passion began. i dabbled in some lego and clay stop motion as well for a while. but than i started making youtube videos. i had gotten all the parts to build a pc for my birthday a few years after i got the macbook and i was able to do more on it, play better games, record them and me playing them like all the people i watched on youtube. learned a little bit about making those cheesy intros that every youtuber had with the 3d font and crazy dubstep. i moved out of that quickly tho. next was my highschool years, which is were i was introduced to coding. i went to a stem school where students led projects every firday. you can make one if you have an idea that gets passed, or you can join a group. for my first year i participated in two groups, the first one had a simple little game they were running on a raspberry pie. i forget what the premise was, i was mostly just getting familir. second half of the year i joined a freind of mines project to make a VR game in unity. i did this successfully, but the game was pretty bland. it was cool to play in my own vr enviorment with the tech being so new. i had a lot of fun doing that. after that tho, the next year, i moved away from the coding and tried to make a clothing company with my freind. i was in charge of the website, we just used bigcartel i beileve or some free commerce building app. the website was alright but thats not really making a website. i transfered highschools after that year so the friday student led projects were no more. but i still tinkered here and there on my own time. then i changed my career path tho, from engineering to nursing. so no more coding or anything then i was too busy. covid happened tho after my first year and a half at community college and that complicated things. so i changed my mind again and joined a business administraton course, online through Beal university which i finished with an associates degree. from there i just kept working in hospitality, as thats were i landed after nursing and during business school. i did that for a couple years, got the lead valet role at the hotel i worked at with was 4 stars hotel at the time i think and the restaraunt was forbes diamond rated, no brag but. i learned a lot about hospitality there. but i wanted somthing new, and i was getting the itch to code again after seeing all those ads for bootcamps on instagram. so i looked into them, quit my job at the hotel and went all in. its just been me and my laptop with some part time side work and the support of an amazing mother as i find my next place to be. i love creating things, designing things, making the expericen unique for unsers. i have a diverse background, all of which come together to make me a pretty good listener, temmate, and critical thinker.
